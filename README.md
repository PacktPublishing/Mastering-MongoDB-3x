# Mastering MongoDB 3.x
This is the code repository for [Mastering MongoDB 3.x](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-mongodb-3x?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783982608), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
You will get an overview of MongoDB and how to play to its strengths, with relevant use cases. After that, you will learn how to query MongoDB effectively and make use of indexes as much as possible. The next part deals with the administration of MongoDB installations on-premise or in the cloud. We deal with database internals in the next section, explaining storage systems and how they can affect performance. The last section of this book deals with replication and MongoDB scaling, along with integration with heterogeneous data sources, SQL or NoSQL. By the end this book, you will be equipped with all the required industry skills and knowledge to become a certified MongoDB developer and administrator.
